= Service Health checks

== Rationale

Health checks are used to signal the state of a computing node to another machine (cloud orchstration frameworks, i.e. kubernetes service controller).

In this scenario health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown) and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

Itâ€™s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for humans.

== Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A Java API to implement health check procedures
- A health checks protocol and wireformat
