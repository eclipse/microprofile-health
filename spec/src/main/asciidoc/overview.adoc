= Service Health checks

== Rationale

The Eclipse MicroProfile Health Check (MP-HC) specification defines a single container runtime mechanism for validating
the availability and status of a MicroProfile implementation. This is primarily intended as a machine to machine (M2M)
mechanism for use in containerized environments like cloud providers and containerized environments. Example of
existing specifications from those environments include https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html[Cloud Foundry Health Checks] and
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes[Kubernetes Liveness and Readiness Probes].

In this scenario health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown) and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

The MP-HC architecture consists of a single `/health` endpoint in a MicroProfile runtime that represents the status of
the entire runtime. This `/health` endpoint is expected to be associated with a configurable context, such as a web
application deployment, that can be configured with settings such as port, virtual-host, security, etc.
Further, the MP-HC defines the notion of a procedure that represents the health of a particular
subcomponent of an application. There can be zero or more procedures in an application, and the
overall health of the application as reflected via the `/health` endpoint is the logical AND of
all of the procedure health status.

The 1.0 version of the MP-HC specification does not define how the `/health` endpoint may be partitioned in the event
that the MicroProfile runtime supports deployment of multiple applications. If an implementation wishes to
support multiple applications within a MicroProfile runtime, the semantics of the /health endpoint are
expected to be the logical AND of all the application in the runtime. The exact details of this are deferred to
a future version of the MP-HC specification.

== Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A Java API to implement health check procedures
- A health checks protocol and wireformat
