= Java API Usage

The main API to provide health check procedures on the application level is the `HealthCheck` interface:

```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HealthCheck {

    HealthCheckResponse call();
}
```

Applications provide health check procedures (implementation of a `HealthCheck`), which will be used by the
the runtime hosting the application to verify the healthiness of the computing node.

There can be one or several `HealthCheck` exposed, they will all be invoked when an inbound protocol request is received (i.e. HTTP).

The runtime will `call()` each `HealthCheck` which in turn creates a `HealthCheckResponse` that signals the health status to a consuming end:

```
public abstract class HealthCheckResponse {

    public enum State { UP, DOWN }

    public abstract String getName();

    public abstract State getState();

    public abstract Optional<Map<String, Object>> getData();

    [...]
}
```

The status of all `HealthCheck` 's determines the overall outcome.

== Constructing `HealthCheckResponse`s

Application level code is expected to use one of static methods on `HealthCheckResponse` to retrieve a `HealthCheckResponseBuilder` used to construct a response, i.e. :

```
public class SuccessfulCheck implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("successful-check").up().build();
    }
}
```

The `name` is used to tell the different checks apart when a human operator looks at the responses.
It may be that one check of several fails and it's useful to know which one.

`HealthCheckResponse` 's also support a free-form information holder, that can be used to supply arbitrary data to the consuming end:

```
public class CheckDiskspace implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("diskspace")
                .withData("free", "780mb")
                .up()
                .build();
    }
}
```

= Integration with CDI

Within CDI contexts, beans that implement `HealthCheck` and annotated with `@Health`
are discovered automatically and are invoked by runtime when the outermost protocol entry point (i.e. `http://HOST:PORT/health`) receives an inbound request.

```
@Health
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCheck implements HealthCheck {

    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        [...]
    }
}
```
