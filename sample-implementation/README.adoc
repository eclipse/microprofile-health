# Health API Reference Implementation Notes

The RI TCK coverage currently depends on custom Wildfly Swarm branch:

 https://github.com/heiko-braun/wildfly-swarm-1/tree/mp_health_api


Since this is not published to maven central, test execution is disabled by default and can be enabled with:

```
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=false test
```

## Building the RI


```
git clone -b mp_health_api https://github.com/heiko-braun/wildfly-swarm-1 health-ri
cd health-ri
mvn clean install
```
