# Health Check API Reference Implementation Notes

The RI TCK coverage currently depends on custom Wildfly Swarm branch:

 https://github.com/heiko-braun/wildfly-swarm-1/tree/mp_health_api


Since this is not published to maven central, test execution is disabled by default and can be enabled with:

```
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=false test
```

## Building the Sample Implementation


```
git clone -b mp_health_api https://github.com/heiko-braun/wildfly-swarm-1 health-sample
cd health-sample
mvn clean install
```

## Running the TCK against the sample implementation

- Update the propoerty `wildfly-swarm.version` in `sample-implementation/pom.xml` to the version used in `health-sample/pom.xml` (i.e. 2017.9.0-SNAPSHOT)
- Run the tests with `mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=false test`
