= MicroProfile Health

== Motivation

Health checks are used to probe the state of a computing node from another machine (i.e. kubernetes service controller) with the primary target being cloud infrastructure environments where automated processes maintain the state of computing nodes.

In this scenario, _health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown)_ and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

It’s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for human operators.

== Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A health check protocol and wireformat
- A Java API to implement health check procedures

== Detailed design

=== Protocol

This project defines a protocol (wireformat, semantics and possible forms of interactions) between system components that need to determine the “liveliness” of computing nodes in a bigger architecture.
A detailed description of the health check protocol can be found in the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/tree/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc[companion document].

=== API Usage

The main API to provide health check procedures on the application level is the _HealthCheck_ interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HealthCheck {

    HealthCheckResponse call();
}
```

Applications are expected to provide health check procedures (implementation of a _HealthCheck_), which will be used by the framework or runtime hosting the application to verify the healthiness of the computing node.

The runtime will _call()_ the _HealthCheck_ which in turn creates a _HealthCheckResponse_ that signals the health status to a consuming end:

```java
public class HealthCheckResponse {

    public enum State { UP, DOWN }

    private final String name;
    
    private final State state;
    
    private final Optional<Map<String, Object>> data;
    
    [...]
}
```

=== Constructing HealthCheckResponse

Application level code is expected to use one of static methods on _HealthCheckResponse_ to retrieve a _HealthCheckResponseBuilder_ used to construct a response, i.e. :

```java
public class SuccessfulCheck implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("successful-check");
    }
}
```

=== Integration with CDI

Within CDI contexts, beans that implement _HealthCheck_ and annotated with _@Health_ are discovered automatically and are invoked by the framework or runtime when the outermost protocol entry point (i.e. _http://HOST:PORT/health_) receives an inbound request.

```java
@Health
@ApplicationScoped
public class CheckDiskSpace implements HealthCheck {

    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        [...]
    }
}
```

=== On the wire

It's the responsibility of the runtime to gather all _HealthCheckResponse_ s for _HealthCheck_ s known to the runtime. This means an inbound HTTP request will lead to a series of invocations
 on health check procedures and the runtime will provide a composite response, with a single overall status, i.e.:

```json
  {
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
      {
        "name": "first-check",
        "status": "UP",
        "data": {
          "key": "foo",
          "foo": "bar"
        }
      },
      {
          "name": "second-check",
          "status": "UP"
      }
    ]
  }
```

The link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/tree/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc[companion document] contains further information on forms of interaction and the wireformat.

== SPI Usage

Implementors of the API are expected to supply implementations of _HealthCheckResponse_ and _HealthCheckResponseBuilder_ by providing a _HealthCheckResponseProvider_ to their implementation. The _HealthCheckResponseProvider_ is discovered using the default JDK service loader.

A _HealthCheckResponseProvider_ is used internally to create a _HealthCheckResponseBuilder_ which is used to construct a _HealthCheckResponse_. This pattern allows implementors to extend a _HealthCheckResponse_ and adapt it to their implementation needs. Common implementation details that fall into this category are invocation and security contexts or anything else required to map a _HealthCheckResponse_ to the outermost invocation protocol (i.e. HTTP/JSON).
