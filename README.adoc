= MicroProfile Health

== Motivation

Health checks are used to probe the state of a computing node from another machine (i.e. kubernetes service controller) with the primary target being cloud infrastructure environments where automated processes maintain the state of computing nodes.

In this scenario, _health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown)_ and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

It’s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for human operators.

== Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A health check protocol and wireformat
- A Java API to implement health check procedures

== Detailed design

=== Protocol

This project defines a protocol (wireformat, semantics and possible forms of interactions) between system components that need to determine the “liveliness” of computing nodes in a bigger architecture.
A detailed description of the health check protocol can be found in the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/tree/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc[companion document].

=== API Usage

The main API to provide health check procedures on the application level is the _HealthCheck_ interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HealthCheck {

    HealthCheckResponse call();
}
```

Applications are expected to provide health check procedures (implementation of a _HealthCheck_), which will be used by the framework or runtime hosting the application to verify the healthiness of the computing node.

The runtime will _call()_ the _HealthCheck_ which in turn creates a _HealthCheckResponse_ that signals the health status to a consuming end:

```java
public class HealthCheckResponse {

    public enum Status { UP, DOWN }

    private final String name;
    
    private final Status status;
    
    private final Optional<Map<String, Object>> data;
    
    [...]
}
```

=== Constructing HealthCheckResponse

Application level code is expected to use one of static methods on _HealthCheckResponse_ to retrieve a _HealthCheckResponseBuilder_ used to construct a response, i.e. :

```java
public class SuccessfulCheck implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("successful-check");
    }
}
```

== Different kinds of Health Checks

This specification provides different kinds of health check procedures.
Difference between them is only semantic.
The nature of the procedure is defined by annotating the _HealthCheck_ procedure with a specific annotation.

* Readiness checks defined with _@Readiness_ annotation
* Liveness checks defined with _@Liveness_ annotation
* Backward compatible checks defined with _@Health_ annotation


A _HealthCheck_ procedure with none of the above annotations is not an active procedure and should be ignored.

=== Readiness check

A Health Check for readiness allows third party services to know if the application is ready to process requests or not.

The _@Readiness_ annotation must be applied on a _HealthCheck_ implementation to define a readiness check procedure, otherwise, this annotation is ignored.

=== Liveness check

A Health Check for liveness allows third party services to determine if the application is running.
This means that if this procedure fails the application can be discarded (terminated, shutdown).

The _@Liveness_ annotation must be applied on a _HealthCheck_ implementation to define a Liveness check procedure, otherwise, this annotation is ignored.


=== Backward compatible check

To provide backward compatibility with previous specification version, a _HealthCheck_ implementation with _@Health_ annotation is still supported.

**@Health annotation is deprecated**, new procedures shouldn't use it.


== Integration with CDI

Any enabled bean with a bean of type _org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck_ and _@Liveness_, _@Readiness_ or _@Health_ qualifier can be used as health check procedure.


Contextual references of health check procedures are invoked by runtime when the outermost protocol entry point (i.e. _http://HOST:PORT/health_) receives an inbound request


```
@ApplicationScoped
@Liveness
@Readiness
public class MyCheck implements HealthCheck {

    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        [...]
    }
}
```

Health check procedures are CDI beans, therefore, they can also be defined with CDI producers:


```
@ApplicationScoped
class MyChecks {

  @Produces
  @Liveness
  HealthCheck check1() {
    return () -> HealthCheckResponse.named("heap-memory").state(getMemUsage() < 0.9).build();
  }

  @Produces
  @Readiness
  HealthCheck check2() {
    return () -> HealthCheckResponse.named("cpu-usage").state(getCpuUsage() < 0.9).build();
  }
}
```

== SPI Usage

Implementors of the API are expected to supply implementations of _HealthCheckResponse_ and _HealthCheckResponseBuilder_ by providing a _HealthCheckResponseProvider_ to their implementation. The _HealthCheckResponseProvider_ is discovered using the default JDK service loader.

A _HealthCheckResponseProvider_ is used internally to create a _HealthCheckResponseBuilder_ which is used to construct a _HealthCheckResponse_. This pattern allows implementors to extend a _HealthCheckResponse_ and adapt it to their implementation needs. Common implementation details that fall into this category are invocation and security contexts or anything else required to map a _HealthCheckResponse_ to the outermost invocation protocol (i.e. HTTP/JSON).
